Name repo and then get URL from green Code button, make sure you get SSH URL

once you have repo >> get clone <insert URL from Github>

git add  <file name>  >> adds newly edited file to staging area

git commit >> commits previously staged files 
    you do not need to add a message to it ((git commit -m)), you have edited it to have VSC open up when only entering git commit, from there you will 
    enter whatever message you need to in a tab, save it, and then exit the tab. 

git push >> will push all staged files up to Github
    from here, newly edited files should display on github.
    DO NOT TRY TO EDIT FILES FRIM Github. 

git log >> a log book of all commits **hit Q to exit log**

git status >> will show status of items in/out of staged area
